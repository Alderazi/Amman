### ***Description:***
###### The Amman Project is a smart driving assistance system designed to enhance road safety using computer vision and machine learning. The system captures and analyzes real-time video from a vehicle’s surroundings to perform the following core functions:
1. Speed Limit Detection: Recognizes road signs and alerts the driver when they exceed the posted speed limit.
2. Safe Distance Monitoring: Measures the distance between the driver’s vehicle and others to recommend safe stopping times.
3. Accident Risk Estimation: Analyzes vehicle proximity and driving patterns to calculate the likelihood of an accident and alert the driver accordingly.
